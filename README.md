# Memory Allocation Simulation

## Overview
The **Memory Allocation Simulation** is a Java program that demonstrates various memory allocation strategies, including **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit**. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to visualize how memory is allocated and deallocated in real-time scenarios.

## Features
- Simulates memory allocation strategies:
  - **First Fit**: Allocates the first available block of memory that is large enough.
  - **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest available block that fits the request.
  - **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available block to minimize fragmentation.
- Interactive GUI for easy user input and visualization.
- Real-time updates showing the allocation and deallocation process.
